    </p>
    <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mayonnaise or salad dressing</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon water (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon margarine or butter</li>
        <li>1 pinch of salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
        In a cup or small bowl, whisk together the eggs, mayonnaise and water using a fork. Melt margarine in a skillet over low
        heat. Pour in the eggs, and stir constantly as they cook. Remove the eggs to a plate when they are set, but still moist.
        Do not over cook. Never add salt or pepper until eggs are on plate, but these are also good without.
